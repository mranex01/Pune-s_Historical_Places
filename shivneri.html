            Shivneri is a hill fort located to the northern side of Pune district with Junnar at its base and was the <strong>birth place of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.</strong> Even though the fort has succumbed to the ravages brought on by time and weather, its structural style is worth a study. The spot where Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was born was reconstructed in 1925 and is known as the Shiv Mandir. In its vicinity is a huge circular water tank called Badami Talav. However, it does not hold water any longer. At the far side to the north is a precipitous cliff. This narrow channel is known as the Kadelot Point. It is believed that criminals awarded capital punishment were handcuffed and thrown down from here. It is from here that one can get a good view of the Manikdoh Dam as also the forts of Hadsar and Chavand. Climbing further you will be able to see the hill fort of Harishchandragad, far behind the mountains. Some of the other views include those of Narayangad, Lenyadri Hill, Arvi Satellite Centreâ€™s antenna and the Giant Meter wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at Kodad near Pune.
